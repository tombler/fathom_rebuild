                        We believe to invest in the youth is to invest in the future. And Fathom is placing its stake in the academic communities where young people are. Susan Davis said, â€œWork is not only a means of survival and meeting basic livelihood requirements. It is also a means of self-expression, self-actualization and vehicle for engaging in ones community. Fathom is bringing its project-based platform to campuses to empower students with the skills and competencies needed to turn their passions into professions and thrive in a 21st century economy.
